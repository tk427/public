# Python
Things I have tinkered with while trying to learn Python.  This Repo includes:
* TimeTracker
  * A simple Python form that writes to an excel spreadsheet to track the time spent working on specific tasks.
 * GeolocationHeatmap
  * A script I found on Reddit, that generates a heat map based on your googole location history.  The URL of the original repo is in the script.
