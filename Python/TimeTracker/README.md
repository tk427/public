# Python Task Time Tracker
  A simple time tracker form that writes to an excel spreadsheet.  This is a small and agile way to track tasks you have worked on for later more offical time reporting.
  I have included a simple excel template that is configured with the spacing necessary to look more presentable.  You can use that spreadsheet or generate your own.
